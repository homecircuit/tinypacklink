## Concept M2C
Regarding the cloud design to use the TinyPackLink protocol, you need to set up an MQTT broker or any other cloud service that supports MQTT communication. Here's a general outline of how you can design the cloud infrastructure:
1. Set up an MQTT broker on a cloud server or use a cloud-based MQTT service.
2. Configure your Arduino ESP32 to connect to the MQTT broker using the MQTT library and provide the necessary credentials (server IP, port, username, password, client ID).
3. Establish the MQTT connection in your Arduino code and subscribe to the desired MQTT topic(s) to receive messages from the cloud.
4. Implement the message decoding logic using the decodeMessage() function described earlier. Call this function whenever a message is received via MQTT.
5. To send messages to the cloud, create the TinyPackLink message as described earlier and publish it to the appropriate MQTT topic using the MQTT library.
6. On the cloud server or service, set up a listener for MQTT messages and process the received messages according to your application's requirements.

## Concept M2M
For M2M (Machine-to-Machine) communication using the TinyPackLink protocol, you can consider the following commands or topics that can be supported:
1. Status Update: Machines can send periodic status updates to each other, providing information about their current state, availability, and any relevant parameters.
2. Data Exchange: Machines can exchange data between each other, sharing information such as sensor readings, measurements, or any other relevant data.
3. Command Execution: Machines can send commands to each other, instructing them to perform specific actions or tasks. For example, one machine can send a command to another machine to start a particular operation.
4. Collaborative Processing: Machines can collaborate and share processing tasks, dividing a complex task among multiple machines to achieve faster and efficient processing.
5. Fault Detection and Recovery: Machines can communicate with each other to detect faults or errors and take appropriate actions for recovery or error handling.
6. Synchronization: Machines can synchronize their actions and behaviors to ensure coordinated operations. For example, multiple machines can synchronize their timings to perform a task simultaneously.
7. Event Notification: Machines can send event notifications to each other, indicating the occurrence of specific events or triggering certain actions.
